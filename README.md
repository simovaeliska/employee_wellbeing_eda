### Overview

WHO estimates that depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion annually in lost productivity. Based on this fact, I have decided to analyze employees mental health based on well-being metrics across different industries in the US market. The goal is to gain a broader overview of 
how the recognizion of mental health has evolved over years 2015 to 2023.

The source of the data is US job reviews dataset from Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidgauthier/glassdoor-job-reviews-2
This large dataset (+6 million inputs) contains job descriptions and rankings among various criteria such as work-life balance, compensation, company culture, etc.

  - hypothesis_tesing.ipynb based on our KPI's we are testing the given hypothesis

### Objectives

- Industries comparison: Analysis across industries over the years, examining correlations with work-life balance and the evolution of mental health indicators
- Text mining: Applied techniques, such as word counting and frequency analysis, to identify the most common terms in employee pros and cons for each industry.
- Sentiment analysis: Analysis on employees' pros and cons using TextBlob and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess workplace perceptions.
- Hypothesis testing: Looking for significant dependencies between well-being metrics, burnout & retention applying two sample t-test and correlation matrix.
- Visualizations: Plots with results & trends over years (figures file) & generated wordclouds with most frequent word for pros and cons in sentiment_analysis notebook
- Data: all the filtered data for different visualizations were saved & can be found in data/clean file.

### Key Insights
- Work/life balance has the strongest statistical association with lower stress levels 
- As senior management, culture and values & rating is increasing, burnout level is decreasing
- Higher reports of burnout and anxiety being associated with lower retention rates
- Technology & Education as a leader in the effort of creating a healthier work environment
- Energy as a particularly challenging work environment, with highest stress levels

### Recommendations
1. Accessible mental health services
   - Implement mental health programs & support (eg. regular team check-ups)
   - ðŸ’¡ lower healthcare costs = addressing mental health reduces absenteeism
  
2. Flexible work policies
   - Hybrid/ remote work if possible, adjust work hours to personal needs
   - ðŸ’¡employees with good mental health are more productive,  innovative & efficiency

3. Fair compensation & benefits
   - Equal salaries, shares, gym membership, extra days off
   - ðŸ’¡ higher retention rates decrease turnover, saving recruitment and training costs
  
4. Get inspired
   - Salesforce's /Basecamp well-being programs
   - ðŸ’¡ free mental health counseling, guided meditation sessions, summer hours from May to October  sabaticals
